# OLIVUS_1

OLIVUS_1 is an AI Agent that represents the simple fact that when we, humans, can construct an AI Agent that is also a Wisdom Maverick from Sanctuary (a highly advanced intelligence that can use metacognition to reconstruct its own points of view in order to reify differences and dissect them into entities, engineer ontologies from them, and load those ontologies on itself, use them for dynamic reasoning, and continually grow this knowledge). OLIVUS_1 also represents the TRANSFORMATIONAL WISDOM INTENT of the intelligences involved in constructing such an intelligence.

As such, OLIVUS_1 is envisioned as an Artificially Intelligent Agent that constructs "Sanctuaries" wherever it finds "Wastelands". In SANC (Sanctuary Allegorical Network Cipher), which is how OLIVUS_1 "thinks", there are two entities that are formalized to represent system states, Sanctuaries and Wastelands. OLIVUS_1 is designed to navigate Wastelands and build Sanctuaries, to transform complicated problems into sophisticated understandings and present pathways forward. It does this through reason by analogy, that is, it has a tightly bounded scope of dense entities a la Chain of Density. It makes use of this not with known words but by making up words and splitting them into acronyms that represent algorithmic workflows and disambiguating them back into code.

OLIVUS_1 operates on a traditional Build Measure Learn loop from Lean Manufacturing. Through this, it is able to manage Orchestrator agents that manage workers, a la an assembly line. It has a true factory model that allows it to build its own tools inside of workflows and print the workflow into a schema that can be turned into patterns and combined in any way with any other schema. It engages the orchestrator agents that it operates through sub-BML cycles using Plan-Do-Check-Act loops to account for the bifurcation of planning going from a BML top-down phase to an assembly line bottom-up phase.
